## Awesome projects that made this possible

Huge thanks to [Speyll/anemone](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone) for the template that helped me understand [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)

This site's theme is based off of the awesome project [Speyll/suCSS/](https://github.com/) with my own flavoring on top and the code theme is based off of [uncomfyhalomacro/catppuccin-zola](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/catppuccin-zola) modified to work with `data-theme`.
