I saw this [post](https://jade.fyi/blog/pre-commit-exif-safety/) from [jade.fyi](https://jade.fyi) on using a git hook to clear exif data from your images before you commit them and realized I should probably implement that too lol. Interestingly jade also uses zola for her site but she used pre-commit hooks whereas I wanted to do something that used native git hooks.

I started with the naive method of just having a `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file that would run `exiftool` on the input but after realizing that hooks placed there wouldn't be synced to the repo decided that wasn't the best way. I moved to using a script that would symlink files from the `hooks` directory to `.git/hooks`. It worked moderately well but due to the fact that I used (yes I feel the shame admitting this [:uw_embarrassed:](https://cachet.dunkirk.sh/emojis/uw_embarrassed/r)) `#!/bin/bash` instead of `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. Not realizing my mistake and believing it to be related to the symlink I found [this stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4592838/symbolic-link-to-a-hook-in-git/#:~:text=While%20you%20can%20use%20symbolic%20links) answer which taught me that you can use `git config core.hooksPath hooks` to move the hooks directory to `./hooks` in the root of your repo! After doing that and it still not working (i feel very dense writing this lol) I finally realized that the shebang was wrong and then it worked!

Is there anything at all to learn from this? Well yes actually! You can use the script below and the `git config core.hooksPath hooks` setting to scrub your own images!

> hooks/pre-commit
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if exiftool is installed
if ! command -v exiftool &> /dev/null; then
  echo "Error: exiftool is not installed.  Please install it." >&2
  exit 1
fi

while read -r file; do
  case "$file" in
    *.jpg|*.jpeg|*.png|*.gif|*.tiff|*.bmp)
      echo "Removing EXIF data from: $file" >&2
      exiftool -all= --icc_profile:all -tagsfromfile @ -orientation -overwrite_original "$file"
      if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error: exiftool failed to process $file" >&2
        exit 1
      fi
      git add "$file"
      ;;
    *)
      ;;
  esac
done < <(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR)

exit -0
```
