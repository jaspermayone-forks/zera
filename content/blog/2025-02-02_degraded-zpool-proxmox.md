I decided to finally fix the network issues with my proxmox server (old static ip and used vlans which I hadn't setup with the new switch and router) as I had some time today but after fixing that fairly easily I discovered that my main `2.23 TB` zpool had a drive failure. Thankfully I had managed to stuff 3 disks into the case before so loosing one meant no data loss (thankfully ðŸ˜¬; all my projects from the last 5 years as well as my entire video archive is on this pool). I still have 3 more disks of the same type so I can swap in a new one 2 more times after this.

## Actually fixing it 

First I had to find the affected disk physically in my case. Because I was stupid I didn't bother to label them but thankfully the serial numbers of the drives are stuck to them with a sticker so that wasn't terrible.

Now we can run `lsblk -o +MODEL,SERIAL` to find the serial number of our new drive.

Our two current drives are `3QD0BG0J` and `3QD0BQ5G` as we can see in proxmox but we can also see that they have partitions and `sdb/3QD0BN6V` does not so thats our target drive. Now we can find the disk by id with `ls /dev/disk/by-id | grep 3QD0BN6V` which gives us:

> ls /dev/disk/by-id | grep 3QD0BN6V
```bash
ata-ST3750640NS_3QD0BN6V
```

We are going to go with the first id so no we move on to the zfs part. Running `zpool status vault-of-the-eldunari` we can get the status of the pool:

> zpool status vault-of-the-eldunari
```bash
  pool: vault-of-the-eldunari
 state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be used because the label is missing or
        invalid.  Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue
        functioning in a degraded state.
action: Replace the device using 'zpool replace'.

```

We can add our new disk with `zpool replace vault-of-the-eldunari 9201394420428878514 ata-ST3750640NS_3QD0BN6V` but first we wipe the disk from proxmox under the disks tab on our proxmox node to make sure its all clean before we restore the pool after we do that we also initalize a new gpt table. Now we are ready to replace the disk. Running this command can take quite a while and it doesn't output anything so sit tight. After waiting a few minutes proxmox reported that resilvering would take 1:49 minutes and it was 5% done already! I hope this helped at least one other person but I'm mainly writing this to remind myself how to do this when it inevitably happens again :)
