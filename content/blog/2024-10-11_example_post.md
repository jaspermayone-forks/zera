This post is for me to just test out all the features and styling of the blog, and to
make sure that if I change the CSS or anything I don't break any of it! This is also a
sort of light style guide for blog posts in general.

<!-- more -->

## Section Headers

Sections headers (prefixed with `##` in markdown) are the main content separators for posts, and
can be [linked to](#section-headers) directly. To link to them, the header's text needs to be
*kebab-cased*, so the above would be `#section-headers`.

Not quite a section header, the `<!-- more -->` tag is used to indicate where a post should be split for rss purposes. This should generally be right after the first paragraph.

### Table of Contents

Section and sub-headers can be used to generate a table of contents at the start of the page. To
enable this feature for a post, add the following to the page's frontmatter:

> toml
```toml
[extra]
has_toc = true
```

The table of contents will only ever be generated for `##` and `###` headers. I don't particularly love the look of it and tend to write shorter posts so I hardly use it.

## Embedding Code

I tend to do this alot so this is an important bit of the blog. All code blocks with a code type are progressively enhanced with a copy button.

### Syntax Highlighting

If you want syntax coloring, you put the name of the programming language immediately after the ticks.
So writing this:

~~~md
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
~~~

Will produce this:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Code Block Title

Sometimes it can help to give a header to a code block to signal what it represents. To do this, you put
a single-line block quote immediately before the code block. So by prepending the following code with
`> src/index.ts`, I can produce this:

> src/index.ts
```ts
Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response("Hello, world!");
  }
});
```

### Inline Code

As seen above, sometimes code items are mentioned in regular paragraphs, but you want to
draw attention to them. To do this, you can wrap it in back-tick (\`) quotes. For
example, if I wanted to mention Rust's `Vec<T>` type.

```md
`Vec<T>`
```

You can wrap a link around a code tag if you want to link to the docs, for example I could
link to the [`Option<T>::take_if`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.take_if)
method directly.

```md
[`Option<T>::take_if`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.take_if)
```

## Block Quotes

I can display a quote by prepending multiple lines of text with `>` like so, which will
wrap it in a `blockquote` tag:

> "This text will appear italicized in a quote box!"

### Cited Quotations

For when I want to have a citation, I can use the html `<cite>` tag after the quote text and it
will prepend it with a nice `â€”` em dash.

> "I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half
> as well as you deserve."
>
> <cite>Bilbo Baggins</cite>

## Embedding Media

Images and videos are a great way to break up content and prevent text fatigue.

### Images

Images can be embedded using the usual markdown syntax:

```md
![alt text](/path/to/image.png)
```

![NOISE1 screenshot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvNTU2NDU0LzI5MTYzNzgucG5n/original/6GRlJM.png)

When there are multiple paragraphs of text in a row (usually 3-4), and nothing else to break
them up, images can be interspersed to help prevent text-wall fatique.

You can also add captions to images:

```terra
{{/* img(id="https://url.com/image.png" alt="alt text" caption="this can be ommited if you want or added! It's optional :)") */}}
```

{{ img(id="https://cloud-owp7vmln1-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_1846_1_.jpg" alt="MacBook proprietary blade SSD" caption="it really was a rather sleek design; shame that apple got rid of it in favor of soldered on storage") }}

### Videos

To embed a video, you use the `youtube(id="", autoplay?=bool)` shortcode e.g.

{{ youtube(id="NodwjZF7uZw") }}

### Bluesky posts

This is handled by a shortcode `bluesky(post="")` and takes the post url as a parameter. These will automatically attach images and videos.

{{ bluesky(post="https://bsky.app/profile/svenninifl.bsky.social/post/3lnkivz3ans2k") }}

## Miscellaneous

You can also create `<hr>` horizontal rule tags using `---` in markdown, like so:

But these should be used sparingly, if at all.
